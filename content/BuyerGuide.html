			This page will provide information so that you can make an informative decision on what computer components that you buy and for how much you should pay. The market is flooded
			with all types of each components, some will be very expensive and some will be very cheap, some will increase the performance of your computer some will not, all these could be
			the choice for you but that will only depend on what you want to do on your computer. This buyers guide is what we believe one should look for when building a computer but if the 
			things mentioned below does not provide you with anything valuable then we highly recommend going to some of the links provided on our "Reference Materials" page.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have not already been to our "Basic Functions" page, we highly recommend you visit this page, this will help you during this building process. If you 
			already have visisted the page, already have a good understanding of basic functions of the components,or simply do not have time, that's fine too. Let's get started.

			When building a computer it's best to choose your processor first because this will decide which type of motherboard you will get due to the socket type and everything else will 
			revolve around that due to form factor and the heat sink for that processor. Currently the market has only two sellers of processors which is AMD and Intel, each provide a wide 
			selection of processors from high-end to basic and expensive to affordable and each provide two completely different socket types. Each have their own strengths, due to AMD having 
			more cores than Intel processors it handles a higher workload but Intel has a slight edge when it comes to 1080p gaming.

					<br>
					Gaming needs much more resources then doing your basic tasks but this will depend on the game because more older games will be handled better by newer hardware, but due to the issue of resources
					this is why you have a GPU which is dedicated to such tasks therefore would require much less strain on your CPU. This is also why we recommend not spending to much on a processor and allocate some 
					of your funds to the GPU. You can could also invest into a higher-end processor to simply future-proof your computer so that you can handle future games. Light video editting could also be done 
					with the processor in this range but hardware at this range lack the amount of cores to high-end work. You should look for a processor that has around 6-8 cores, and and speed of around 
					3.7 GHz - 4.2 GHz.

			After deciding on your processor, you will have to decide a motherboard for that processor. First thing to look for is if the socket type matches the socket port of the motherboard, either you have an AM 
			socket from AMD or a LGA socket from Intel. After you have to decided on form factor because this decide the type of chassis you will have, if you have a ATX board you will only fit in Full Tower and
			Mid-tower chassis and if you have a micro-ATX then you will most likely be using a mini-ITX chassis. During this entire process you should keep a look out for the features that motherboard provides, 
			this will be the major factor for the pricing of the motherboard, some of these features are if it includes WIFI card, the type of RAM it supports, M.2 slot availability and how many, and data ports transfer
			speeds.

					These motherboards have the basic features that a motherboard offers, for example, front/back USB ports, Onboard Audio, Onboard LAN, Memory slots, and Onboard video output. These are some of the most basic 
					features which is why these types of the motherboard are priced on the lower end of the spectrum. If these features are less than what your looking for I recommend going into the next price range because

					Motherboards at this price range starts to provide more features that are meant for increasing your performance, for example, overclocking, M.2 ports, higher RAM capacity, and more RAM slots. 
					These features are not all necessary but that will depend on your budget and what you care about, for example, more RAM in general will increase your performance but having a M.2 SSD will 
					increase the load time of your files. This price range also has boards that start to offer multi-video card capabilities because of the technology is available on the boards and also that their
					are more PCI ports to use. If these features are less than what your looking for I recommend going into the next price range because they will most likely be available their, feature like a

			The next hardware component you should focus on is the Videocard because it will probably will be the most important component or not needed at all. A GPU is meant to assist the CPU but that mean depending 
			on what your doing the CPU can handle anything you do and does not need assistance, therefore depending on the purpose of this computer you can skip this section. A Videocard is not very cheap it will 
			probably take up a large amount of your budget therefore if your doing basic tasks then you will not a Videocard but if your planning on gaming or using your computer as a workstation a Videocard is necessary.
			Currently the market is occupied mainly by two GPU companies which are AMD and Nvidia, AMD is provides more affordable Videocards and Nvidia is unmatched in high-end products, different companies produce 
			Videocards with their own distinct features attached to AMD and Nvidia GPU, and we recommend looking for the model your looking for and then decide from that selection which feature would be best. Due to the 
			wide selection a Videocard comes in a multitude of sizes for the same Videocard therefore you should take into account of the dimensions for the selected Videocard, this will play a big role when selecting
			the computer case.

			RAM is essential for you do tasks both your CPU and GPU relies on the RAM so that they can operate, the more the there is the more efficent your computer will run while doing these tasks. That being said
			if you already have a motherboard or you have decide what motherboard you are going to get then you should take note on the specifications of that motherboard especially the supported RAM capacity, supported 
			RAM frequency, the number of RAM slots, RAM slot channel configuration, and the type of RAM the motherboard supports, each will be a limiting factor on which RAM you should choose. The price of the RAM will 
			vary from factors such as RAM amount, the number of RAM sticks in a kit, special features like RGB lighting, and RAM type.

				<p>
					When it comes to what you should buy for RAM the main factor is the amount that a kit provides and the frequency it has because other factors like the heat spread over the RAM does not play any role in any 
					benefits. We recommend 16gb so that you can do most tasks on your computer from basic productivity tasks to high-end gaming, if that is not within your price range then the minimum you should be 8gb of RAM 
					but doing multiple tasks at once will hinder your performance. For digital works we recommend 32gb because those take a bigger toll on the GPU and CPU for processing power and have more RAM will help with 
					those tasks making it more efficent. After deciding the amount and you have reviewed the specifications of your motherboard you should consider the frequency and the channel configuration, if your motherboard
					does not support the frequency that you buy for the motherboard there will be problems. Channel configurations will decide on the kit of RAM sticks you buy because that is how the motherboard will use the RAM
					you provided by how the RAM sticks communicate with each other, if you have a quad-channel board then your motherboard will allow for all four sticks to communicate, if you have dual only two will communicate,
					some may have single channel slots, these can also be combined onto a single board that has four RAM slots but has two dual channels instead of quad-channel. This also plays a factor because the reason RAM is
					sold in kits is that the producer found that communication between these sticks are perfect but if you buy two single sticks their may be a possibility that their is interference, this most likely will not lead 
					to problems but it's a possibility.

			When deciding on a storage device first you should consider what your doing on the computer, productive tasks my require very little capacity on your storage device mainly due to the products of such tasks only
			requiring minimal space, gaming would require quite a large amount due to games becoming bigger and bigger every generation, and lastly for a workstation would vary in size depending on the industry. Also when it 
			comes to storage capacity, as the size increase so does the price. There are currently three types of storage devices on the market each with their own benefits and weaknesses.

					<span class = "label">SSD:</span>
					<br>
					The SSD is probably the fastest out the three types of storage devices, it can read and write data better than the other two but it has the highest cost per gb. The price also goes up when the SSD is using a M.2 
					port instead of SATA, this makes the data transfer speed even quicker. When it comes to longivity the SSD has the longest lifespan because it does not require physical parts and movement to operate. When considering 
					what storage devices to get we recommend having at least a small SSD along with a HDD so that you can install your OS onto the SSD instead of the HDD so that you can have fast start-up when turning on your computer
					and still have plenty of storage space due to your HDD which we recommend to be at least 1 tb, if you plan on using only a SSD we recommend getting at least 512gb because if you are gaming often then you will 
					quickly run out of room otherwise if your only doing productive tasks you should have ample storage space but will eventually run out.

					This is a more old fashion storage device where your data is stored on a disk whereas the SSD stores data purely digital thus having the slowest speed out of the three storage devices, that being said that is in
					comparison to the other two devices in no means is a HDD slow. In terms of longivity of a HDD it has the worst lifespan at about 4-years because it is completely reliant on physical moving parts thus giving it 
					ware and tare. A HDD is the best when in terms of budget because it has the best cost per gb out of the three. We recommend if your going planning on getting a HDD that you should pair it with a SDD of a decent 
					size because you see a noticable difference in speed when it comes to start-up and will see a dip in performance as time passes. We do not recommend getting purely a HDD as storage because we feel that the lifespan
					is too short, that would mean that you would have to replace the storage device eventually which is a big hassle for the price point but we do understand if your budget is limited and we do think that HDD is the best
					priced then not having one at all.

					This device is a hybrid of a SSD and a HDD thus having both their strengths but as well as weaknesses, it has the storage capacity of a HDD but better loading speeds, it partially stores the data on a disk and on

					retailers and even in specialized retailers might only have the product as a refurbished, therefore we cannot recommend this product but if you happen to stumble on this product then it would be a good option to 
					pick up but even though it has better speeds then a HDD we still recommend a SDD along with the Hybrid Drive because the Hybrid Drive still faces issues of longivity and the help mitigate this issue you should have

		<p>
			When it comes to choosing a Power Supply it depends on what hardware you have in your computer because hardware like Videocards might require a seperate power cables to directly connect to the card to get extra power,
			therefore when choosing your power supply you should consider if the power supplies has all the necessary components. When searching a Power Supply you might start noticing that some products have ratings, these 
			ratings are important to consider because they provide a certification to the Power Supply to gurantee an efficent power conversion from AC outlet to DC supply to the components, currently the standard for this rating is 
			"80 plus" which means that the power source supplies at least a 80% efficency and the color rating would mean that it actually has a higher rating depending on the loading, the colors start from Bronze, Silver, Gold,
			Platinum, and Titanium.
		</p>
		<div class =  "recommendation">
			<div class = "spacing"></div>
			<div class = "recommendcontent"> <!-- div that contains the recommendation for the PSU section -->
				<p>
					We recommend that you get at least a 450W Power Supply and hopefully at least a "80 plus - Bronze" rating because even if you do not plan on getting a Videocard or the Videocard does not have a seperate point for 
					the power cable then 450W will still be ample close to the bare minimum for most machines to operate, with the power rating this will make it more cost effective in terms of power consumption for your residence. If 
					you plan on getting a Videocard or if your Videocard has a seperate power port then it is more likely to increase the Power Supply, this increase could specific to the Videocard itself which can be found on the 
					specifications or you get a power supply to meet most Videocard requirements, our recommendation with regard to this issue to getting one that will cover most Videocards because this would future proof your computer
					and would not cost you to much more. For workstations we also would recommend a higher rating at least for your computer because you will be using a computer for longer periods of time.

					A Full Tower is the largest Computer Case size, it accommodate for the most hardware, it can handle the most fans, it can handle the all current Videocards in term of size, and it can handle all current heatsinks. 
					Generally the Full-Tower when fully built is much heavier compared to the average computer size. The Full Tower allows for the most room for wiring managing out of the three cases. We recommend this case if you have 
					enough budget because one of the major downside of the Full Tower is pricing which in comparison to the other towers is much more expensive therefore we do not recommend this item if you do not have enough funds but 
					getting this Full Tower will allow you to future proof your computer to accommedate future hardware and this tower is the best if you plan to do custom for your computer, for example, a reservoir for water cooling. 
					This case will definitely accommedate your build, your build can consist of 4 Videocards, any heatsink, accommedate massive amount of storage with a combination of SSDs and HDDs, and a motherboard with any form factor.

					<span class = "label">Mid-Tower:</span>
					<br>
					A Mid-Tower is the most common Computer Case, it probably is the case you imagine when you hear the word desktop, due to this fact the Mid-Tower occupies the majority of the market. This will need more attention when
					it comes to wiring because you do not have the same room as a Full Tower and everything is closer to each other. We highly recommend getting this Computer Case because it generally is priced better than the other two
					because of the huge selection available. The Computer Case has benefits from the other two choices with the size of the Full Tower but is more spacious. The Computer Case can fit generally most builds with a ATX 
					motherboard with one or two Videocards, a ATX or micro-ATX motherboard, a good amount of storage with a couple of SSDs and HDDs, and most heatsinks.

					<span class = "label">Mini-ITX:</span>
					<br>
					Even though the Mini-ITX size is the smallest out of the three cases it actually has a high cost because these are more unique of a case and has a small amount on the market, this is due the fact that the case can
					only accommedate one form factor of motherboard and it the less popular one therefore not much demand for this case. Due to the limited space wiring will be need to be precise. When it comes to using this case you 
					have to plan very carefully because you have little to no room for hardware, the benefit of getting this case is it being unique and being the most spacious out of the three. Therefore we do not recommend getting 
					this case for your build because it does limit the hardware that you can select and is generally more expensive then what your getting as product. With regards to future proofing you will need to plan much more in
					comparison to the other Computer Cases when adding/replacing hardware. Your build will generally consist of one or no Videocard, a Water Cooled heatsink or a small Air Cooled heatsink, and limited storage with 
					potentially using SSDs and HDDs otherwise we advise only using SDDs.
