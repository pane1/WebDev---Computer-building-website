			be bought with consideration with each other because they effect each other the same way. These components consist of:

				<p>
					The core of the computer is the central processing unit (CPU), this compoent acts as the brain of the computer. The CPU
					dictates how component should do their own respective functions. We will mainly be looking at how the CPU will effect
					the other components that you will be working on, these components consist of the storage device, videocard, power supply, 
					RAM, and motherboard. The CPU currently have two socket types, the AM and LGA types, each with their own sub types which is due to
					the generation of CPU, these sub types are for example AM4 and LGA 1200. AMD is the developer of the AM socket types and Intel 
					is the developer of the LGA socket types therefore their products will definitely be those respective types. A good way to 
					distinct between the two socket types is if one has the pins of the chip itself, AMD chips will have the pins on the chip and the
					intel chips will have no pins and only flat contact plates. Figuring out the sub type of socket won't be as easy but would require you 
					to simply research the name or the CPU or the serial number printed onto the chip to find the sub type.
				</p>
				<p>
					The CPU connects through to every device through the motherboard, the CPU connects to the motherboard via CPU socket port which also 
					will have to match the socket types that the CPU has. A good indicator of what type of socket port is on the motherboard is the opposite
					of the chip indicator, due to the AMD chip having pins the AMD socket port on the motherboard will have holes to fit the pins and the Intel
					socket port will have pins in them to connect to the contact plates. Figuring out the sub type of socket port won't be as easy but would require you 
					to simply research the name or the CPU or the serial number printed onto the board to find the sub type.
				</p>
				<p>
					The processor works with the storage device to manage data, the processor will be able to read from and write to the storage device,
					this is the process of saving and retrieving/openning your files. This process also relates to topics such write/read speeds which are 
					purely dependent of the type of storage device that is being used. The processor is connected to the motherboard and the motherboard is
					connected to the motherboard. The storage device is usually connected using a SATA cable to the motherboard, in more recent years storage
					devices started to use other ports of the motherboard such the PCI port and the M.2 port on motherboards.
				</p>
				<p>
					The CPU will always be either moving or calculating data, this due to the nature of the computer with only understanding numbers and not using any
					language which means that the CPU will need many numbers to list all possible functions of every component of the computer. Now people have figured that 
					it is easier to store some of this information instead of calculating it therefore RAM is needed. The processor and the RAM does the most work in a computer 
					because when the processor is processing data and instructions the RAM is where they store the data temporarily before either sending this data to the their own 
					respective locations or is used later by the processor. The processor connects to the motherboard via the CPU socket and the motherboard connects to the RAM via
					the RAM slots.
				</p>
				<p>
					As mentioned before the CPU is used to calculate and manipulate the data but the type of work that can be done on a computer increases as time passing on and the amount of 
					resources demanded also increases therefore the computer needs another component to take the amount of processes from the CPU which is the GPU. The GPU is basicly a CPU chipset 
					but that focuses on tasks that relates to graphics. The CPU connects to the GPU through the motherboard, the CPU connects to the motherboard through the CPU socket port and the 
					GPU connects to the motherboard through the PCI port.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most used resources in a computer is electricity, electricity provides power to the devices but it also is way for these components to communicate by simulating a binary
					system where a low charge represents a zero but high charge represents a one. The CPU as mentioned before it controls everything even the amount of electricity comes into
					each components. The power supply connects to the motherboard with PSU cables which then be able to connect to every other component, such as the CPU.

				<p>
					A motherboard provides connectivity between the hardware components, as you have seen above the motherboard connects to every component, for example, CPU, Videocard, RAM, Power Supply,
					and Storage device. The motherboard acts a circuit for all the components with soldered copper wires and capacitors to help manage the power, the ports you see have thousands of copper
					wires connected together so that the motherboard and the component can have a good and stable connection. A majority of motherboards come in two different sizes which are ATX and Micro-ATX, 
					others might be present but those usually are unique and are made with a specific type of machine in mind, for example, a server motherboard might use a Super Micro form factor. Motherboards
					are sorted into the type of CPU it can support, for example, as mentioned above their are two types of CPU socket series the AM and LGA series, the motherboards must have a CPU socket that 
					can support the CPU because the CPU is the brain of the computer and due to the architect of the CPU no motherboard has both a AM and LGA series socket or even different generations of the 
					same series. Most current motherboards at least consist of a CPU socket, RAM slots, 24-pin power port, PCI port, SATA port, CPU fan port, and a IO back panel. 
				</p>
				<p>
					A motherboard connects with a CPU via CPU socket, as mentioned before the CPU socket have to match otherwise it will not work and might even damage the CPU chip and CPU socket. When it comes 
					connecting a CPU each CPU socket type is different from the other, the Intel CPU will have connection pins on the motherboard socket port, be sure not to damage these pins because otherwise 
					you will need a new motherboard, an AMD CPU will have the connection pins on the CPU chip and most of the time will not damaged but by chance the CPU does you will most likely not be able to 
					use that CPU. The motherboard has two different locking mechanisms for the CPU, the Intel socket type will have a latch or cover for the CPU chip, the AMD socket type will have a mold for you
					to fit all the pins in and a latch to move the mold to the connection plates on the motherboard.
				</p>
				<p>
					A Videocard uses a PCI port to connect to the motherboard, the motherboard allows for the CPU to connect to the CPU which can not control the control the GPU. Depending on the price and size of
					the motherboard you can fit more than one videocard but installing one Videocard will take the place of two PCI ports (the Videocard will cover the PCI port under the one your already using) 
					therefore make sure you have enough space to install the multiple Videocards. The PCI port will provide power but for most higher end Videocards will need a direct cable or two connecting the 
					Power Supply to the Videocard. For such a complicated device you will need to install drivers onto your computer so that the system knows the specification and configuration that the Videocard 
					has so that the CPU can optimally run the Videocard. The PCI ports are usually secured using a clip on the PCI port itself but some more expensive motherboards will have release mechanisms to 
					release the Videocard.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Storage Devices uses a SATA cable to connect to the motherboard's SATA ports with the exception of the M.2 SSDs all Storage Devices use this method. A motherboard will usually have multiple 
					SATA ports therefore allow you to have multiple Storage Devices. There are currently three types of SATA cables, SATA 1, SATA 2, and SATA 3, Storage Devices uses all three types so make you have
					the current SATA ports and cables, each have their own speeds, SATA 1 has a speed of 1.5gb/s, SATA 2 has a speed of 3.0gb/s, and SATA 3 has a speed of 6.0gb/s. The SATA cables will have a built-in
					clips to secure itself onto the motherboard.
				</p>
				<p>
					A motherboard has RAM slots so that you can insert RAM sticks. The number of RAM slots, the frequency of the RAM slots, the type of RAM slots, and the memory configuration will all differ depending
					on the motherboard. Most motherboard will have at least two RAM slots and most motherboard will be compatible running DDR3 and DDR4, older motherboards will use DDR1 and DDR2. With reguards to 
					frequency most DDR3 RAM runs at a frequency of 1333MHz to 2400MHz and most DDR4 runs at a frequency of 2400MHz to 3200MHz, the range frequency that a motherboard depends on the price because higher 
					frequency are either possible through overclock or otherwise would not be compatible therefore the more expensive the motherboard the more likely that the frequency would be compatible. The RAM 
					configuration would depend on the motherboard but most more expensive motherboards will likely run dual channel or higher because they are more likely to have RAM slots whereas the lower end of 
					motherboards will have less RAM slots therefore limited on the memory configuration. The RAM is secured in the RAM slots using the two clips at both ends of each RAM stick to secure the RAM stick, 
					you will have to unclip both ends to remove the RAM stick.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Heatsink as mention before need to match the socket type of the motherboard because each socket type will have the distant and position of the holes be different from the other, this also needs to 
					needs to align with the back plate that is provided with the heatsink or motherboard which will actually connect with the heatsink and not the motherboard itself. Older heatsinks that comes with the 
					CPU itself (also known as stock heatsinks) have a their own respective mounting methods, AMD will have built-in clips that is attached to the back plate for the heatsink to clip on and Intel will use 
					pins attached to the heatsink that you will need to pop-in into the back plate, more modern will use mounting brackets to hold down the heatsink and the brackets will attached via mounting screws to 
					the back plate, this creates more and better contact with the CPU due to the additional pressure, there might be some resistance but you want a good connection between the heatsink and the CPU chip. 
					The heatsink will also need power for the fan so you will connect a power pin from the fan to the motherboard.

				<p>
					A Videocard actually is a very complicated piece of hardware itself, its composed of components that are very similar to a computer system, for example, it has a cooling system, its own RAM (also known
					as VRAM), and the GPU. As mentioned before a GPU is basicly a CPU that has a focus on handling graphics matters so that the CPU does not have to bare the burden, so the architecture of the GPU is very 
					similar to the CPU but consist of more ALU (arithmetic logic units) which allows for more pipeline processing which means it can handle more calculations compared to a CPU in the same clock cycle, but
					has smaller number of cache and control units allowing the CPU to handle more general tasks. As mentioned in the CPU section, processing requires RAM because a chip can only retain a certain amount of 
					data and if the data is lost or not represent it take to much time to recreate or retrieve it from storage therefore we store the additional data in RAM therefore similar to a CPU having general RAM to
					use, a GPU will have VRAM (also known as virtual random access memory) which is RAM dedicated for the GPU whereas general RAM could be used by multiple components, the VRAM will give your computer some
					breathing room especially when it comes to dealing with high resolution graphics with either with games or even watching a movie, the size of the VRAM is also compariable to general RAM where more expensive
					Videocards have up to 8gb of VRAM. For more powerful GPUs they produce a lot of heat because of how much processing the GPU is doing therefore the Videocard it also needs a heatsink like a CPU chip, 
					usually this heatsink it attached to the Videocard already and does not require you to install or to replace, the heatsink helps cool the VRAM on the card. A Videocard will also a combination of output 
					ports for you to plug in your HDMI ports, DVI ports, VGA ports, Display ports, and Mini-display ports to connect to your display device.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of working with other components, as mentioned in the CPU section the CPU will allocate work that focuses on graphics to the GPU and this done through a connection to the motherboard through 
					a PCI port on the motherboard but the Videocard is such a powerful piece of hardware most modern Videocards need a seperate power cable to power the component. This is due to the limitation of the 
					copper on the PCI connector on the Videocard not being able to handle such high currents thus if you run a Videocard with a seperate power port using only the PCI connection it will burn/melt the PCI
					connector and most likely damage the PCI port as well.

				<p>
					Random access memory or RAM is a type of memory, this type of memory is a high speed but temporary memory, the reading and writing speed is much faster than then hard drive memory but the memory on
					RAM is los after the loss of power. RAM is neccessary because this is the location where the computer stores commonly used data of programs or a temporary storing location for data that will be used
					later in the same operation. One might equate RAM as short-term memory. RAM has many iterations because people has been developing a larger and faster forms of RAM, the most recent iteration of RAM
					is the DDR4 type, which was proceeded by the DDR3, and so on. DDR4 and DDR3 are still used by most machine whereas DDR2 and DDR1 is less common if not simply not used anymore due to the inferior 
					performance they provide. Like most components of a computer RAM operates on a clock-cycle therefore the frequency of RAM is the speed of RAM, this will determine how fast data is read or written into
					the RAM, the frequency of RAM is proportional to the type of RAM in regards to DDR4 would have higher frequencies where DDR3 would not, DDR4 runs at a frequency of around 2400MHz to 3200MHz, and 
					DDR3 runs at a frequency of around 1333MHz to 2400MHz. RAM itself is a black chip soldered onto the RAM stick which is sometimes covered by a heat spreader to help cool the RAM, the heat spreader 
					is the metalic plate or holder that is on a stick which comes in different colors and shapes and even lights up using LEDs.
				</p>
				<p>
					As mentioned in the Videocard section their is a type of RAM called VRAM which is RAM exclusively for the GPU and is located in a different location, which is on the Videocard itself and is not modular 
					like the general RAM that one can purchase, to modify VRAM you would need to remove the Videocard heatsink and unsolder the VRAM from the Videocard, this is highly ill advised.

				<p>
					The computer case or the chassis is probably the least neccessary component of the computer but it is something that has to be considered at every step of the building
					process because when creating your computer the size of the chassis is limited so when your deciding your interior components you'll need to make sure those components fit.  
					The chassis comes a variety shapes and sizes the most common chassis sizes are Full Tower, mid-tower, and mini-ITX. These sizes also determine the size of the motherboard
					size because the chassis has pre-drilled holes for where the screws from the motherboard will go into thus only certain form factor motherboards fit, the Full Tower and mid-tower
					allows for ATX motherboards and the mini-ITX chassis allows for the micro-ATX motherboards, the former is the most common form factor because the case for that motherboard is the 
					most common where as the ladder is more unique and more of a custom job. The chassis also comes with a multitude of features like LED lights, multiple USB portts, and fan controls,
					these features all vary in availability depending on the chassis price range. A chassis can also cool your computer other than the heatsink which is the case fans or chassis fans,
					these fans are attach to the chassis through screws, the amount of fans and the size of fans all are determined by the type of case, usually the mid-tower and Full Tower have 
					around five fan slots and the mini-ITX usually only have one but most of the time only one chassis fan is needed. Usually the case would have extra slots to fit in other components,
					for example, SSD trays or mounts, HDD trays, PCI output slots and IO port slots, these slots avaiablility also depend on the chassis size and price.
				</p>
				<p>
					The motherboard will mounted onto the computer via motherboard holes with screw threads already present in the case for you to install the motherboard, if the holes do not align that would mean 
					that the case you have does not support the motherboard that you have, do not try to create threads holes for your current motherboard because this would lead to instability in your Computer Case 
					structure. The IO panel will need a plate to fit perfectly to your Computer Case. The Computer Case will have wire managing components to it depending on the case but they will have at least a back 
					area (usually the right panel area of the Computer Case) to hide/group the bulk of your cables that you will have connecting to your motherboard. The Computer Case will might also connect to your 
					motherboard because your Computer Case will at least have a power button and a couple of USB ports and to make these function you will need to connect them to your UI pins on the motherboard (usually 
					located on the bottom right corner along with a legend).

				<p>
					For long while when computers were being developed the standard storage device were HDDs (also known as hard disk drive), in the past two decades the standard has changed to due to the 
					introduction of SSDs (also known as solid state drive). A HDD is a series of enclosed platters with a ferromagnetic coating, data will be written and read from the disc with a "head" similar
					to vinyl records being played, the head will read the direction of the magnetization on the disc and that is how binary is printed onto a disc. Due to the mechanism of the HDD this is a purely
					mechanical process which means this would result in the slowest speeds. Due to have multiple layers of disc to store memory the storage capacity of a HDD is quite large, on average most HDD can
					store at least 1Tb of data, but due to the nature of HDD being mechanical the longivity of the HDD is put into question most HDD would last around 4-years. A SDD uses flash memory to store 
					information, the binary system is created by a grid of NAND flash cells (also known as blocks) can store the data and using a controller of the SSD this can instantly locate the data and due 
					to the lack of mechanical parts this leads to producing the fastest speeds. Due to mechanism of the SSD using chips full of flash cells there can only be a limited amount of space on a board 
					therefore a limit on the amount of chips of a board and also due to the nature of having more flash cells resulting to having a larger capacity this leads to a price increase as a result of a 
					increase of flash cells, that is why SSD are more expensive then HDD. As SSDs are a newer technology this would mean it is still being developed, the development of the SSD has lead to the M.2 SSDs,
					this new SSD type uses a M.2 connector and M.2 port instead of the typical SATA cable and SATA port, using the M.2 port the SSD has a mucher greater transfer speed than any storage device before
					by reaching speeds of around 4gb/s whereas normal SSDs max out at around 600Mb/s.
				</p>
				<p>
					As mentioned in the motherboard section the storage devices connects to the motherboard in two ways using the SATA ports or the M.2 ports, most motherboard will have the a couple of SATA ports 
					but it would depend on the price of the motherboard if it would have a M.2 port. To secure the storage devices after connecting the non-M.2 storage devices you would need to use one of the
					computer storage trays in the Computer Case itself, the case most likely offer a couple of HDD trays and occasionally some SSD trays or mounts depending on the model.

				<p>
					A heatsink may not play a noticable function on your computer but heatsinks are very important because this allows for your CPU to run at a high load but not overheat, as mentioned before processing
					produces a lot of heat therefore your CPU should produce the most and as the heat builds up there is a chance that your CPU would overheat which could damage the CPU component. If you have ever seen
					a heatsink before it basicly composed of two parts, one is a radiator and the other is the fan, the radiator has a contact plate which draws the heat from the CPU to the radiator which is made from
					many fins to create a large surface area to disperse the heat, the fan helps cool these fins to further dissipate the heat. For the heatsink to have the most effect is when the contact plates touches 
					the CPU chip as much as possible but not all heatsink are made perfect and some may not get the max amount of area of the CPU chip or due to the architecture design of a CPU chip it does not allow for
					maximum surface area contact, to solve this problem we use something called Thermal Paste, which is a kind of liquid that is applied between the heatsink contact plate and the CPU chip to fill in the 
					holes, this paste also is very effective at conducting temperature therefore heat travel through the paste easily.

				<p>
					A Power Supply is piece hardware in the computer that not obvious when comes to function on a computer but is very essential for the operation of a computer. The Power Supply converts
					the AC current from your outlets to DC current which the type of power that your computer components uses, it also acts a regulator for your computer because it controls the voltage 
					in your computer to prevent overheating. The Power Supply is scaled on the Watt unit (W) therefore when your going in store to find a certain size Power Supply you will have to state
					what the Wattage is for that product. To power your computer you do not actually have to directly connect wires to the other components seperately some do like a motherboard and 
					possibly your Videocard but most components can get power through your motherboard and through which ever port that component is connected to either it is a M.2 port, a USB port, a SATA
					port, a CPU socket, and a 4 or 6 pin power port. To power the motherboard though it takes a 24 pin connector that comes attached to the Power Supply to power the motherboard which in turn
					powers the rest of the components.
