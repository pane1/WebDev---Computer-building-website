	<p> <!-- Accessories page introduction -->
		When it comes to having a computer most people try to build the most powerful but that is not just enough for them anymore, they want something that is not only powerful but something 
		that looks powerful, something out of Sci-Fi fiction. This where enthusiasts and the industry got creative with what already is needed for a computer and what can go into a computer. 
		Currently there has been two types of additional features that have been trending to increase the aesthetic of a computer system which are water cooling and LED lighting. Both concepts
		are very new in the community of computer enthusists and still improving, that being said their is no limitations on what you can do in the computer building community, we highly recommend
		doing some research about the really unique computer builds some people have come up with in the community. Due to the nature of being an additional feature these accessories are pretty 
		expensive and more of a luxary then a neccessity.

			<p>
				Even though water cooling is pretty common practice when it comes to CPU cooling but what we talking about is water cooling everything else in your computer system. Currently it
				is possible to water cool a CPU, Videcard/GPU chip, RAM sticks, and a motherboard. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To water cool these components you will have to attach something called a "Water Block to each one. A Water Block is basicly a heat spreader, the spreader has one side 
				touching with its polished cold plate and the other is stack of microchannels that contact a coolant. These microchannels acts as radiator fins which allows for a large 
				surface area for the heat dispersed. These blocks will now be able to cool their independent components but to water cool them you actually create a network connecting these 
				component using tubing to create a path for your cooling solution to travel through to cool each component. Most of these components will be made custom and most likely will 
				not be available in most retail stores, also it should be noted that not all computer components layout the same therefore you need to make sure each block is compatible 
				with your specific component. Most sellers provide a well documented specification for these blocks so make sure you read carefully before buying. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To connect these components you will need tubing and fittings, with these you cannot create your network. There is two type of tubing flexible and rigid, the flexible type is
				similar to a hose and rigid look like glass pipes. A couple key factors to note in term of difference between the two is safety, complexity, materials, chemical resistance, and price. 
				In terms of safety flexible tubing is more safe because of the type of fittings you will be getting which are Compression fittings that will act as a nose you need to push into and 
				create a tight grip that will ensure coming loose will be impossible whereas rigid tubing does not create as much of a grip and will come off when you pull it by hand but tight none 
				the less. In terms of complexity flexible tubing is much easier to work with because you can simply cut the tubing whereas rigid tubing you will need a Heat Gun to bend the tubing 
				and 90-degree adapter to guide straight tubing, one thing to note in general with both is to be careful when creating bends because you do not want a kink which will block your flow. 
				In terms of materials the flexible tubing options are all pretty much the same where you can get colored or non-colored, an external layer cover or none, basicly a hose. Rigid tubing 
				however how much more options each more complicated then the next, you can get PETG tubing which is a much better acrylic tubing, glass tubing, and even metalic tubings. In terms of 
				chemical resistance depending on what cooling solution you might want to use which is not limited to water their might be chemical deterioration to your tubing therefore tubing like 
				flexible and PETG/acylic tubing are less durable and could cause the plastic to break-off and slowly clogs your network, but glass is the best option in terms of chemical resistance. 
				In terms of pricing flexible and PETG/acrylic tubing are pretty much equal but rigid tubing could potentially more expensive if you choose to opt for a metalic tubing. Both these 
				provide the same performance but it is more personal preferance on what you choose. To connect all these tubes you need fittings to lock-in. Tubes have two dimensions inner and outer
				diameters (ID and OD). The thickness/size of the tubes gives a general idea of durability but their is no metric when it comes to the two measurements. When picking fittings for your
				tube you simply have to follow the specification specified by the seller, when choosing your fittings you cannot be cheap when it comes to buying these because out of all the components
				in your network if their is a leak it is most likely due to poor fittings but that being said no network is perfect and it could be something else. Fittings comes in many options are
				each are as good or better than the others but this all preference but the default choice would be Compression fittings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now that your creating a network with thse components you will need be able to move this liquid around because normally you only have closed network which it has a built in 
				pressure to move the liquid but now that you have multiple components with more tubing you will need a water pump. A water pump is device that will move the water in a system,
				it uses electric motor to move an impeller which creates pressure to move the liquid. A pump will always have a inlet and outlet port which will make it much easier and safer
				to drain your system. Some may choose to opt for the reservoir, these reservoir can either be a seperate component from your water pump device or come together with your water
				pump device, either way reservoir serve no pratical purpose overall computer performance, this device houses extra liquid in your network to help reduce the air bubbles enter 
				your cooling network and acts a filling port for your cooling solution. They much easier to install into your computer but require more vertical room due to the size of this 
				device. One thing to note if your opting for a reservoir make sure the reservoir is above your water pump so that gravity will do most of the work for your pump. When you 
				create a network everyone bares a burden and in this situation the more components you add to the loop overall increases the temperature and this will also increase the water 
				pump output and radiator size. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This network will obviously have radiator to cool the solution itself because the Water Blocks cool the component but the solution will eventually build up heat which is 
				dissapated by the radiator, these radiator can either be very small or very large but this depends on your network. Their are two factors when you choose a radiator size and
				thickness, size is talking about the number of fans it can fit and the more fans it can fit that means the more surface area to cool in the radiator, thickness is simply the
				dimension of the radiator in terms of millimeters. Out of two factors size is the more important factor due to having more surface area therefore does a much better job at cooling
				and also it is a physical factor which can be limited due to your case size. To cool these radiators you will need fans, which by all means subjective on which one is better 
				this will depend what you prefer and the size of your radiator.

			<p>
				One thing that people have noticed that makes a computer look very futuristic or sci-fi is lighting which why the community and the industry prefers this feature by either integrating
				this feature into mandatory components or even buying a RGB LED kit to manually it to their computer themselves. The industry has been moving to add LEDs to every component such as 
				Videocards, motherboards, cooling fans, and even RAM sticks.
			</p>
			<p>
				The easiest way to add some LED aesthetic to your computer is buying the integrated ones on your components. Most leading component manufacturers that support gaming offer parts with RGB 
				LED lighting, companies like Asus ROG, MSI, and NZXT offer variety of selection of products that basic or has the LED feature built in. To properly have these components running properly 
				you will need drivers for those components, these drivers will also give several other features, for example, controlling the LEDs, turning them on or off. Due to the large amount of 
				software that you might need to have to run multiple components companies MSI and Asus offer software to combine all them into a centralised location for you to manage.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next level is a better option if you already have components and are not looking to replace them another inexpensive solution would be using LED strips. These strips have LEDs built in
				on one side and uses a attaching method which are either a magnetic strip or a peel-off adhesive strip. The strips are powered usually by a USB which is connect to a USB header on the 
				motherboard which not only allows for power but allows for control of the strip. Some LED strips alternate methods of controlling it, some LED strips come with a remote to control the 
				function of the LED and some can be controlled through an app on the phone.
